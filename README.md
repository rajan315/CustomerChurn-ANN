## ï»¿Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using artificial neural networks (ANNs). Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. By identifying potential churners, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about telecom customers, including demographics, services subscribed, contract details, and churn status. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features using Min-Max scaling.
Feature Engineering: Relevant features are selected and engineered to improve model performance.
Model Building: An artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The ANN architecture is designed to handle the classification task of predicting customer churn.
Model Training: The ANN is trained on the preprocessed dataset using an appropriate loss function and optimization algorithm.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its predictive performance.

## Results
The trained ANN achieves a training accuracy of 88% and a testing accuracy of 75%, indicating that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Further analysis is conducted to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement are identified.

## Conclusion
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses, especially in highly competitive industries such as telecom. By leveraging machine learning techniques like artificial neural networks, companies can gain valuable insights into customer behavior and take proactive measures to reduce churn rates. This project serves as a demonstration of how machine learning can be applied to real-world business problems for informed decision-making.
